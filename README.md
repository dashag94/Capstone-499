Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been a rewarding experience that has prepared me to take the next big step in my career. Through coursework, projects, and building my ePortfolio, I have grown both technically and professionally. These experiences have strengthened my skills, shaped my career goals, and helped me position myself as a strong candidate for technical roles. This is especially important now, as I am actively interviewing with Meta for a Product Manager role, where I aim to combine my business expertise with the technical knowledge I’ve gained through this program.
Throughout this program, I’ve worked on projects that demonstrate my abilities in key areas such as algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. For example, in my Data Structures and Algorithms course, I implemented Dijkstra’s Algorithm to solve complex pathfinding problems efficiently. This project helped me understand how to design scalable and optimized solutions for real-world challenges. In Database Management, I worked on designing and managing relational databases, writing SQL queries, and implementing efficient data retrieval, which are critical skills for building reliable applications.  
Working with teams has been another important part of my journey. In my Software Engineering course, I led a group project to develop a mobile app prototype. As the team leader, I made sure tasks were divided clearly, deadlines were met, and the final product was cohesive. This experience taught me how to work well with diverse team members and keep projects on track through effective collaboration.  
Communication has also been a key focus, especially when presenting technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders. In my professional role as a Product Manager, I often work with teams across business and technical areas, gathering requirements and presenting solutions in ways that everyone can understand. My coursework supported these skills further, especially during projects where I created technical documentation and user-focused designs, such as in the User Experience Design course.  
Security has been another area where I’ve grown. Through my Cybersecurity Fundamentals course, I learned how to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in software systems. I applied this knowledge in projects by using secure coding practices and implementing encryption techniques, ensuring that my solutions are not only functional but also safe for users.  
The artifacts in my ePortfolio showcase my skills and growth as a computer science professional. Each project highlights a different technical strength, such as designing efficient algorithms, building scalable and well-structured databases, and developing secure, user-friendly software. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems, design effective solutions, and deliver high-quality results. For example, the work I did on Dijkstra’s Algorithm ties closely to my database project, as both show my ability to handle and optimize data. Similarly, the mobile app project highlights how I can create systems that balance user needs with technical functionality.  
Overall, my ePortfolio represents the journey I’ve taken to transition from a business-focused Product Manager to someone who is technically equipped to lead innovative projects in the tech industry. With the skills and knowledge I’ve gained, I feel confident in my ability to contribute to a company like Meta, where I can help create impactful products. As I continue through the interview process with Meta, I know this program and my ePortfolio have prepared me to show how my technical abilities and business experience make me the right fit for a role in their team.
